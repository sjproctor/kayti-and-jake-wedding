          Kayti and Jake started dating in the summer of 2021. While that kicks
          off this part of the story, their paths had crossed a few times before
          that summer. Kayti and Jake met for the first time over 30 years ago.
          Jake&apos;s mom, Sue Dahlgren, was Kayti&apos;s preschool teacher.
          Kayti, along with many other tots, was invited to the Dahlgren house
          for a Halloween party in 1993. Kayti attended in her most favorite
          costume, Princess Jasmine.

          Since Kayti and Jake are very nice people, they naturally have many,
          many friends. An overlap in their friend groups found Kayti as a
          roommate to Jake&apos;s college girlfriend in 2011. Kayti and Jake
          stayed good friends over the next 10 years, often running into each
          other around town. Kayti loved seeing Jake and getting one of his
          signature hugs.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          In 2021, Jake had back surgery and Kayti reached out during his
          convalescence with an invitation for a short walk to catch up and
          chat. The two talked about life, love, where they were in their
          journeys, and what their futures held. Their short walk ended up
          lasting over three hours. Neither had expected this to be the start of
          a life-changing relationship. They both intended to continue on their
          respective paths, but there was no denying it. They were smitten.

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
          Fluttery feelings aside, they took it slow and allowed their
          relationship to develop organically. They were both determined to
          honor their goals, friends, and family. But they knew this was
          something special. Before too long, I love yous were said and they
          began happily merging their lives. In the summer of 2022, Kayti
          finished her graduate degree and moved into Jake&apos;s house.

          In January 2023, the Dahlgren and Proctor families spent a beautiful
          seven days in Belize. The nine-person crew of parents, siblings, and
          partners got along beautifully! While this was quite the adventure in
          itself, Jake had a surprise. During a tour of the Mayan ruin
          Xunantunich in western Belize, the group climbed to the top of the
          largest monument that afforded views all the way to Guatemala. On the
          top of the structure, 130 feet from the valley floor, Jake proposed.
          Kayti, of course, said yes!
