            The Boise airport is small and easy to navigate. It is a 12 minute
            drive to downtown and a 6 minute drive to Kayti and Jake&apos;s
            house.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Both Uber and Lyft pickup and drop off at the airport.</p>

            Boise public transportation is all but non-existent but both Lyft
            and Uber are available in Boise and tend to be pretty quick (unless
            you are downtown at 2 am).

          <p>If you choose to rent a car you can do so from the airport.</p>
