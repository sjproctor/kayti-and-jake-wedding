          I am invited to the celebration in August?
        </h3>
        <p>Heck yes you are!</p>
        <p>
          If you are excited about celebrating with Kayti and Jake, you are
          invited. That being said, we know life is busy and Kayti and Jake
          don&apos;t want anyone to feel obligated to attend if it creates a
          hardship in any way.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">Should I RSVP?</h3>
        <p>
          Please do! We want to make sure we plan for the right number of
          guests.

        <br />
        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">What&apos;s the party vibe?</h3>
        <p>
          The celebration will be in Kayti and Jake&apos;s backyard. There will
          be beverages, food, music, and dancing. Think more summer BBQ hang
          less traditional wedding reception.

        <br />
        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">Can I bring my kiddos?</h3>
        <p>Bring the fam! Humans of all age are welcome.</p>
        <br />
        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">What about my dog?</h3>
        <p>
          As you know, Kayti and Jake love dogs. But, there are going to be a
          lot of people and open gates in the yard so Kayti and Jake have asked
          not to have pets. Their own pup, Lola Moon will be at doggy daycare
          during the celebration.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">
          What&apos;s the schedule for the party?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We&apos;ll kick things off around 5 pm with beverages, snacks, and
          music. Dinner will be available from 6 pm to 8 pm. We&apos;ll do a
          toast to the bride and groom around 7 pm. The party will wind down
          around 9 pm out of respect for Kayti and Jake&apos;s neighbors.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">What should I wear?</h3>
        <p>
          The party will be held outdoors in Kayti and Jake&apos;s backyard. We
          will have shade tents and misters, but expect it to be hot. August
          days in Boise typically hit 90 degrees. With that in mind, please wear
          whatever makes you feel comfortable. We will be on grass and gravel
          surfaces so choose your footwear accordingly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">What should I bring?</h3>
        <p>
          Yourself, your people, and your party pants! We will provide dinner,
          snacks, water, non-alcoholic drinks, beer, wine, cocktails, and other
          party amenities. Beverage contributions would be very much
          appreciated. If you have dietary concerns and prefer to bring your own
          food we will have some extra cooler space.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">
          What&apos;s the gift situation?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Kayti and Jake feel very lucky to have a home and life together, so
          there is no need for any gifts beyond your well wishes. They would
          prefer your presence rather than presents!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to mark the occasion of their marriage with a gift,
          they would be more than grateful.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-extrabold">Where should I park?</h3>
        <p>
          Parking will be on the street in Kayti and Jake&apos;s neighborhood.
          You should expect to park a couple blocks away and walk. Please be
          respectful of Kayti and Jake&apos;s neighbors and do not block
          driveways. If you are going to be drinking alcohol, DO NOT DRIVE. We
          recommend riding your bike, carpooling, or using ride shares.
