            When Kayti and Jake decided to get married they only wanted two
            things. They wanted to throw a party to celebrate with family and
            friends, and they wanted to make very few decisions about said
            party.
          </p>
          <p className="px-2 text-xs">
            So here we are. This website is full of decisions not made by Kayti
            and Jake for which they are very grateful.

            I will continue to add updates so please check back!
